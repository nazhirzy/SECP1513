## Reflections

1. Technology and Information Systems

   This course served as a general introduction to many different aspects of computer science and technology ini general which will serve me as a backbone for further studies. industry visits also introduced me to a look into the actual business I will be going to in the future.
   
   The only improvement i would suggest is more regular assessments so students can refresh and remind ourselves aboout the topics

2. Database

   This course explained went in depth to the methods of data managing using mysql and everything else regarding data from theoretical to practical implementation. The project and assignments gave me an understanding into the use and capabilities of data storing for systems.
   
   An improvement that I think could be done would be to move this course slightly further the syllabus, as it would give the chance for these concepts that are introduced in this course to actually be implemented in projects made by students from former courses.
   
3. Software Engineering

   Software Engineering introduced me to the more managerial side to computer science with software development practices, diagrams, and techniques to supplement programming software.

   What I think would benefit this course is to focus on more specific techinques and practices and put less an emphasis on learning every single approach to software development as it might overload students(as I experienced) from the amount of information to process.

4. Network Communications

    This course served as a look into networking in technology, going in depth on the layers of network communication, routers, switches, wireless, and other aspects of networking.

   I think the depth in which this course delved into networking would only really be necessary for network students and most of the information in the course will be not entirely relevant for the other students. As such i think the course should be more of an introduction and less a full in depth look.

5. Programming Techniques II

   This course is the continuation of the previous semesters programming course. I enjoyed the course as it delved into more programming concepts and techniques. I also assume that this course will be the most vital for me as it is full focused on programming.

   Some of the assessments through the course particulary in the test had questions that asked about very minute and obscure parts of the concepts learned which i struggled with. I think it would serve the course well to focus on the *concept* of what is being learned as it challenges the understanding of the students regarding that concept.

6. Integrity and anti-corruption

   This course was a look into a very important concept of integrity that I think every person should know to some degree. I think this course was quite relevant for myself and my character to shape me to be a better person.

   However, while I think the intent of the course is quite just and important, I believe the implementation is not quite there. The topics discussed were very technical and rather stale. I think a restructuring of the course syllabus would improve the course from where it is now.
